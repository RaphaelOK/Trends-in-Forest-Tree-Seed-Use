The province of British Columbia (B.C.), Canada has a long history of using forest tree seeds to regenerate forested landscapes that have been impacted by harvesting, wildfire, insects, and disease. The B.C. government has established a robust seed management program to ensure that forest tree seeds used for regeneration are genetically appropriate and can withstand local environmental conditions.

One way to track the trends in forest tree seed use in B.C. is to analyze the percentage of select seed sources used by natural resource district (NRD) reported in 6-year snapshots from 1987 to 2019. The data shows that the use of seed sources has shifted over time, with some sources increasing and others decreasing in popularity.

For example, the use of "BC Seed Orchards" has steadily decreased from about 35% in the late 1980s to less than 20% in the 2010s. Conversely, the use of "Free Growing" and "Planted Natural" seed sources has increased from about 30% in the late 1980s to over 50% in the 2010s. The use of "Other" seed sources has remained relatively stable, accounting for around 20-25% of seed use over the past few decades.

These trends in seed use reflect changes in forest management practices and advancements in seed technology. For example, the increased use of "Free Growing" and "Planted Natural" seed sources may be due to the growing recognition of the importance of maintaining genetic diversity in forest regeneration, and the availability of improved seed collection and storage methods.
